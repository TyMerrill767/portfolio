         <h2>It's All About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello, and welcome to my site! I’m Tyler Merrill, a web developer, meaning I handle all the coding and programming of a website. This is where you’ll be able to see my work, or contact me if you have a question, comment, or have some work for me.I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, using frameworks such as Bootstrap, JavaScript, and I’m learning more all the time, so my websites will only get better and more responsive as time goes on. Day by day, site by site, I’m going to do my best to make the web more beautiful. Come on in!</p>

        <h2>I make the web friendlier</h2>
<p>Each and every website I build is designed to be accessible – young or old, tech expert or technologically impaired, even the disabled. When you visit my sites, you’ll know where you are, where the thing you want is, and how to get there. I build websites, not just to make sales, but to make connections.

    <h2>Projects and Other Works</h2>
    <p>My websites are like my children, and you have to spoil your children, right? That’s why I try to go a little beyond the criteria when I build a website, whether it’s a bit of extra Javascript effects, thinking up a dynamic new layout, or testing the limits of a framework.  </p>

            <h3>Restaurant Website</h3>
            <a href="http://inetstudent1.francistuttle.com/tm0864799/1stquarterproject/culinary/index.html"><img src="images/homepagescreenshot.png" alt="restaurant site" class="projscrsht"></a>
            <p>This is the website I made for my first class project, to make a website for our campus fine dining restaurant, District 21. There are three pages: Home (which informs guests of upcoming events at the restaurant and can be returned to by clicking the banner images), About Us (which contains contact and location info for District 21), and Menu. It’s not very responsive, but it was my first ever site, so take this one with a grain of salt.<br />
    NOTE: This was just a class project; all the information on the Home and Menu pages is fictitious, though the contact info is accurate if you want to check them out!</p>

           <h3>Technology Research</h3>

        <p>This site was for a tech research project, about a two-factor password authenticator called Clef (and its companion application, Waltz). This is where I started learning about responsive design, and it actually responds to different resolutions, whether it’s being viewed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. It was a pretty interesting subject; I still use Clef, occasionally!</p>

        <h3>Discography</h3>
        <a href="http://inetstudent1.francistuttle.com/tm0864799/2ndquarterproject/discography/bootstrap/index.html"><img src="images/discoscreenshot.png" alt="discography" class="projscrsht"></a>
        <p>This is where things really started getting interesting. This was my first site made with a framework, namely Bootstrap, and the task was to create a discography for a band of our choice. I chose Wings, the second band of the legendary former Beatle, Paul McCartney. Here I expanded on everything I had taken away from previous projects, now that I was comfortable coding in HTML and CSS and could easily put together a basic page, and even started incorporating some Javascript functionality courtesy of Bootstrap (click the album covers for collapsible tracklists!).</p>
